## TODO
- **Authenticator**
- **ServiceProvider**
  - Test DataModel
  - Test controllers overall
  - Add exception handling (likely just FindPrimesBetween)
  - Add authentication
  - 3 input types to single input type that contains a list of numbers (and have the API verify the number of inputs is right, either on registry or at service itself)

- **Registry**
  - Add authentication
- **Client**


## Questions
- Should a user be allowed to log in multiple times?
- What should login return if the login fails? (Currently returning token as -1)
